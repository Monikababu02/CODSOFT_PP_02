Simple Calculator
This project is a Python-based command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to input two numbers and select an operation. The calculator then computes and displays the result. This simple application is designed as part of my internship task to showcase basic programming and user interaction in Python.

Features:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
The goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental Python skills, including user input, basic control flow, and mathematical operations.
